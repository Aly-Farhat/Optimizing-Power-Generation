# Optimizing-Power-Generation

# Project Overview

This project presents an optimization model for minimizing electricity generation costs in Ontario, Canada while ensuring sustainability. The model incorporates real-world data, considering fuel costs, health impacts, operational expenses, and startup/shutdown costs, while adhering to emissions caps and grid reliability constraints. The optimization results prioritize renewable energy sources and reduce costs by 35.38%.

Features

1) Data-Driven Optimization: Uses real data from Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO).

2) Mixed-Integer Programming Model: Formulated to determine the most cost-efficient and environmentally friendly power generation schedule.

3) Renewable Energy Focus: Ensures sustainability by prioritizing clean energy sources.
